# Python---Billiing-System

# Situation:
Small retailers and supermarkets often face challenges in maintaining accurate bills, applying discounts, and generating clear itemized receipts for customers. A digital, interactive system was required to handle real-time product selection, billing, and discount calculations efficiently.

# Task:
I was tasked with designing and implementing a Python-based billing system that could:

- Accept multiple product inputs with quantities.

- Apply discounts based on purchase amount ranges.

- Generate a clear itemized receipt with total, discount, and final payable amount.

- Ensure the system was interactive and user-friendly for real-time use.

# Action:

Created a dictionary of products mapping names to their prices.

Used loops to continuously accept multiple product inputs until the customer finished shopping.

Implemented conditional logic to apply discounts (5%, 7%, 10%, 15%) based on billing amount.

Built a cart system to store purchased items with quantity and prices.

Generated an itemized receipt displaying product name, unit price, quantity, subtotal, discount, and final amount.

Designed input prompts to collect customer details like name and phone number for personalization.

# Result:

Delivered a fully functional supermarket billing system in Python.

The system processed multiple items in a single transaction with automated discount handling.

Generated accurate, clear receipts that improved billing accuracy and customer satisfaction.

Showcased the effective use of Python loops, conditionals, dictionaries, and input handling in solving a real-world retail problem.
